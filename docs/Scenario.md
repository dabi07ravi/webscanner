**Scenario for Development:**

---

**Setting:** A medium-sized tech company that hosts and tracks various industry-specific events, both in-house and externally. They have just received a contract to monitor and update events for their clientele, ensuring everyone is informed about event changes promptly.

**Characters:**

1. **Project Manager (PM):** Samantha - Coordinates the project, interfaces with the client, and ensures all requirements are gathered.
2. **Lead Developer:** Aiden - Heads the technical side, responsible for system design and assigning development tasks.
3. **Web Scraping Specialist:** Mia - Expert in web scraping, responsible for data extraction.
4. **Backend Developer:** Leo - Focuses on data storage, monitoring changes, and error handling.
5. **Frontend Developer:** Zoe - Works on reporting mechanisms and user interface.
6. **Tester:** Jack - Ensures that the system functions as required.

**Development Scenario Flow:**

1. **Kickoff Meeting:**
   
   **Samantha:** "Alright team, we've been tasked with developing a system to track event changes. The client has provided us with a list of URLs to monitor."

   **Aiden:** "Let's start by setting up our Node.js environment. Zoe, please initialize our project using npm."

2. **Scraping Setup:**

   **Mia:** "For scraping, I recommend using Puppeteer since some sites might have dynamic content loaded by JavaScript."
   
   **Aiden:** "Sounds good, set up basic scraping for a few sites to test its efficiency."

3. **Monitoring and Data Storage:**

   **Leo:** "I'll start with a SQLite database. We can store the previous state of each site for change detection."
   
   **Aiden:** "Perfect. Ensure there's a mechanism to flag changes for notifications."

4. **Notifications System:**

   **Mia:** "Once we detect a change, we'll send an email. I'll use nodemailer for this."
   
   **Samantha:** "Ensure the emails are concise and clear about which event details changed."

5. **Event Differentiation:**

   **Zoe:** "I'll handle the differentiation logic. Trade Shows and Conferences have distinct characteristics, so we can tweak our scraping accordingly."

   **Aiden:** "Prioritize accuracy; we don’t want to confuse the two."

6. **Scheduling and Reporting:**

   **Leo:** "I'm setting up node-cron for weekly scans."
   
   **Zoe:** "Once we have the data, I'll work on generating Excel reports. We'll make sure the client can understand the changes at a glance."

7. **Testing:**

   **Jack:** "I'll start testing once we have the basic flow ready. We need to ensure accuracy for both event types and verify the email notifications."

   **Aiden:** "We'll do continuous testing. As soon as one component is ready, Jack, you start testing it."

8. **Final Review:**

   **Samantha:** "Let’s review the project next week. We'll check if we've met all the requirements and decide on deployment."
   
   **Aiden:** "Agreed. I'll look into AWS for deployment. Let’s ensure our system runs without hitches."

By the end of the development phase, the team has successfully created a robust system as outlined in the plan of action. They coordinate closely with the client to ensure the system is tailored to their needs and is ready for deployment.

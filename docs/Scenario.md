**Scenario for Development:**
---

**Setting:** A medium-sized tech company that hosts and tracks various industry-specific events, both in-house and externally. They have just received a contract to monitor and update events for their clientele, ensuring everyone is informed about event changes promptly.

**Characters:**

1. **Project Manager (PM):** Samantha - Coordinates the project, interfaces with the client, and ensures all requirements are gathered.
2. **Lead Developer:** Aiden - Heads the technical side, responsible for system design and assigning development tasks.
3. **Web Scraping Specialist:** Mia - Expert in web scraping, responsible for data extraction.
4. **Backend Developer:** Leo - Focuses on data storage, monitoring changes, and error handling.
5. **Frontend Developer:** Zoe - Works on reporting mechanisms and user interface.
6. **Tester:** Jack - Ensures that the system functions as required.

**Development Scenario Flow:**

1. **Kickoff Meeting:**
   
   **Samantha:** "Alright team, we've been tasked with developing a system to track event changes. The client has provided us with a list of URLs to monitor."

   **Aiden:** "Let's start by setting up our Node.js environment. Zoe, please initialize our project using npm."

2. **Scraping Setup:**

   **Mia:** "For scraping, I recommend using Puppeteer since some sites might have dynamic content loaded by JavaScript."
   
   **Aiden:** "Sounds good, set up basic scraping for a few sites to test its efficiency."

3. **Monitoring and Data Storage:**

   **Leo:** "I'll be working with MongoDB for our data storage. We can store the previous state of each site and use built-in MongoDB tools for change detection."
   
   **Aiden:** "Great choice. Make sure there's an indexing mechanism for rapid searches and to flag changes for notifications."

4. **Notifications System:**

   **Mia:** "Once we detect a change, we'll send an email. I'll use nodemailer for this."
   
   **Samantha:** "Ensure the emails are concise and clear about which event details changed."

5. **Event Differentiation:**

   **Zoe:** "I'll handle the differentiation logic. Trade Shows and Conferences have distinct characteristics, so we can adjust our scraping strategies for each."
   
   **Aiden:** "Prioritize accuracy; we don’t want to confuse the two."

6. **Scheduling and Reporting:**

   **Leo:** "I'm setting up node-cron for weekly scans."
   
   **Zoe:** "With the data we gather, I'll work on generating Excel reports using MongoDB's aggregation. This will help the client see the changes at a glance."

7. **Testing:**

   **Jack:** "I'll begin testing as soon as the basic flow is ready. It's crucial we maintain accuracy for both event types and verify the email notifications work as expected."

   **Aiden:** "Continuous testing is a must. Jack, jump in as soon as a component is complete."

8. **Final Review:**

   **Samantha:** "Let’s reconvene for a project review next week. We need to ensure all client requirements have been met before discussing deployment."
   
   **Aiden:** "I'll explore AWS for our deployment. It's essential to guarantee our system operates flawlessly."
